# A Basic Website Layout using Create-React-App with Hooks and Routes.

It is a Demonstration project of how different components are laid out.
For this I have used latest Bootstrap V5.0 Beta version to style my component elements.

### Functionality -

Our Service page shows a bunch of cards which are fetching data from "Lorem piscum API" which is a public API which return a bunch of Images JSON based on their width and height.

#### Interesting Part

I tried to show Card Images from a local Array of objects using UseState Hooks and whenever Internet is being wired, It started fetching images data from piscum API.

### Deployment

This Website is Deployed online using Netlify
